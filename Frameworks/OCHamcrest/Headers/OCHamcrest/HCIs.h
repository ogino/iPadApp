    Decorates another matcher, or provides a shortcut to the frequently used \ref is(equalTo(x)).

    If \a matcherOrValue is a matcher, its behavior is retained, but the test may be more expressive.

    If \a matcherOrValue is not a matcher, it is wrapped in an \ref equalTo matcher. This makes the
    following three statements the same:
\code
assertThat(cheese, equalTo(smelly))
assertThat(cheese, is(equalTo(smelly)))
assertThat(cheese, is(smelly))
\endcode
